## Python

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | Libraries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [🏠 Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Boston-Housing-Regression/tree/main) | EDA, Regression Analysis | Built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model to predict Boston median home values using housing features. | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, dmba, matplotlib |
| [📝 Automotive & Electronics Reviews](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/LSA-TFIDF-TextClassifier/tree/main) | EDA, Text Classification | Binary classification on product reviews using TF-IDF, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Random Forest. Compared stemming vs non-stemming approaches. | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, dmba |
| [🌎 World Happiness Score](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/WorldHappiness-TreeModels/tree/main) | Regression | Predicts the World Happiness Score using tree-based regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting). Model performance is evaluated using RMSE and correlation to identify the best predictive model. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn |
| [🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Customer-Segmentation-Hierarchical-KMeans) | EDA, Clustering | Performs unsupervised customer segmentation using hierarchical clustering (single, complete, average, centroid) and K-Means. Data is preprocessed, encoded, and standardized. Clustering performance is evaluated via silhouette scores and optimal cluster selection methods. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, numpy |
| [🩺 Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Diabetes-Prediction-KNN/blob/main/knn_diabetes_model.ipynb)  | Classification | Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using patient health metrics with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Explores multiple values of k to optimize accuracy and includes prediction on new data.  | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn |
| [🛒 Superstore Membership](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Superstore-Membership-Prediction) | Classification, EDA  | Predicts if a customer will purchase a $499 membership using demographic and behavioral features. The project includes data cleaning, feature selection, and modeling with decision trees, AdaBoost, and Bagging. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, dmba |
