## Python

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | Libraries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [üè† Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Boston-Housing-Regression/tree/main) | EDA, Regression Analysis | Built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model to predict Boston median home values using housing features. | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, dmba, matplotlib |
| [üìù Automotive & Electronics Reviews](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/LSA-TFIDF-TextClassifier/tree/main) | EDA, Text Classification | Binary classification on product reviews using TF-IDF, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Random Forest. Compared stemming vs non-stemming approaches. | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, dmba |
| [üåé World Happiness Score](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/WorldHappiness-TreeModels/tree/main) | Regression | Predicts the World Happiness Score using tree-based regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting). Model performance is evaluated using RMSE and correlation to identify the best predictive model. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn |
| [üõçÔ∏è Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Customer-Segmentation-Hierarchical-KMeans) | EDA, Clustering | Performs unsupervised customer segmentation using hierarchical clustering (single, complete, average, centroid) and K-Means. Data is preprocessed, encoded, and standardized. Clustering performance is evaluated via silhouette scores and optimal cluster selection methods. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, numpy |
| [ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Diabetes-Prediction-KNN/blob/main/knn_diabetes_model.ipynb)  | Classification | Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using patient health metrics with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Explores multiple values of k to optimize accuracy and includes prediction on new data.  | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn |
| [üõí Superstore Membership](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Superstore-Membership-Prediction) | EDA, Classification | Predicts if a customer will purchase a $499 membership using demographic and behavioral features. The project includes data cleaning, feature selection, and modeling with decision trees, AdaBoost, and Bagging. | pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, dmba |

| [üìö Student Enrollment & Transcript Management](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Student-Info-Management-PLSQL/blob/main/Enrollment%20Analysis.md) | Academic Data Analysis | A series of scripts designed to perform student information system tasks. This project includes computing total enrollments, retrieving specific student information, handling error messages for missing data, counting course sections by term, summarizing course offerings, and generating academic transcripts with GPA calculations for each student. The scripts demonstrate SQL logic, data manipulation using cursors, conditional handling, and formatted output using DBMS_OUTPUT. | Oracle PL/SQL |

| [üè¶ Association Rules Loan Approval](https://github.com/Giovanna-Cardenas/Association-Rules-Loan-Approval) | Credit Risk & Loan Approval Analysis | This project uses association rule mining to identify patterns in demographic and financial attributes (such as age, income level, and housing status) to predict the likelihood of a client having bad credit. These insights support loan approval decisions. The project includes data analysis in Excel, findings explained in a Word document, and visualized in a PowerPoint presentation, showcasing patterns like ‚ÄúAge 18‚Äì24 & Low Income & Rent => Bad Credit‚Äù with metrics like support and confidence. | Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word |
